# Array

- **Contiguous area** of memory consisting of **equal-size** elements indexed by Contiguous integers.
- **CONSTANT** time access to read and write.

### Multi Dimensional Arrays
- The address of an element:

| (0,0) |      |      |       |      |      |      |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| (1,0) |      |      |       |      |      |      |
|       |      |      | (2,3) |      |      |      |

address (2,3) = address (0,0) + element_size \* ((2-0) * 7 + (3-0))

- row major as shown in the following table.

| (0,0) |
| ----- |
| (0,2) |
| (1,1) |
| (1,2) |

### Time for common operations
|           | Add  | Remove |
| --------- | :--: | -----: |
| Beginning | O(n) |   O(n) |
| End       | O(1) |   O(1) |
| Middle    | O(n) |   O(n) |
- Because for the beginning and middle element, you have to re-place the whole array to make space for the new element.
- **constants time access but not constants time change!**

### Dynamic Arrays
- Store a pointer to a dynamically allocated array, and replace it with a newly-allocated array as needed.

- In the definition of the abstract class of Dynamic Array
    - Get(i): if i<0 or i>=size, return error.
    - Set(i, val): same
    - PushBack(val): add val to the end. if size=capacity, then first twice the capacity and then use a for-loop to copy elements from older array to the new one. Finally let the pointer turn to point at new array.
    - Remove(i)
    - Size()
